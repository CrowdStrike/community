Wondering how contributions work in CrowdStrike projects? Here is a quick rundown!</p> <ol> <li> <p>Find an issue that you are interested in addressing, or a feature you would like to add. These are often documented in the project repositories themselves, frequently in the <code>issues</code> section.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fork the repository associated with project to your GitHub account. This means that you will have a copy of the repository under your-GitHub-username/repository-name.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Guidance on how to fork a repository can be found at https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Clone the repository to your local machine using <code>git clone https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git</code>.</p> <p>GitHub provides documentation on this process, including screenshots, here: https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#about-cloning-a-repository</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a new branch for your changes. This ensures your modifications can be uniquely identified and can help prevent rebasing and history problems. A local development branch can be created by running a command similar to:</p> <p><code>git checkout -b BRANCH-NAME-HERE</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature you would like to add.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add the file contents of the changed files to the \"snapshot\" git uses to manage the state of the project (also known as the index). Here is the git command that will add your changes:</p> <p><code>git add insert-paths-of-changed-files-here</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Use <code>git commit</code> to store the contents of the index with a descriptive message. This message should outline what was changed. For example:</p> <p><code>git commit -m \"Added Dockerfile for Ubuntu-based deployments\"</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Push your local changes back to your account on github.com:</p> <p><code>git push origin BRANCH-NAME-HERE</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Submit a pull request to the upstream project. Documentation on this process, including screen shots, can be found at https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork</p> </li> <li> <p>Once submitted, a maintainer will review your pull request. They may ask for additional changes, or clarification, so keep an eye out for communication! GitHub automatically sends an email to your email address whenever someone comments on your pull request.</p> </li> <li> <p>While not all pull requests may be merged, celebrate your contribution whether or not your pull request is merged!
